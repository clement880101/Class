8/22	Today, we learned about version control tool (VCR) and in particular, git. Then, we dowloaded git and try what we just learned hands on. We tried command such as git add/commit/pull/push etc.
8/25	Today, using pokemon and excel spreadsheet, we tried to prove why spreadsheet database is faulty and that a management system is needed. We started the class by creating a hypothetical pokemon station. We then try to enter the consumer data into a spreadsheet and we identified a few problems.
8/20	Today, we learned to construct a relational database (that is what I think it is called) where we splice up the big and chuncy table into small table and give ID to each instances. We then cosntruct a base table where the ids related to one another are linked together.
9/01	Today, we learned how to construct a ER diagram from a relational database. As homework from last time, the relational database is used as an example to construct the ER. I learned that, in ER, rectangle represents entities, oval represents attributes, and rhombus represents relationship. \
9/05    Today, we learned about the more complex part of ER diagram including weak relationships, relationship with an attribute roles, and relationships with roll. We also cronstruct a few mor ER as a class.
