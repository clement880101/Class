1/11 We listen to Joeph's presentation and work on our own.
1/16 Today we all present our database. 

In the course, I learned the basic idea of database - what process do people go through, how people think when designing one, and what to look out for.
Starting from struggle to understand the ER diagram, I slowly progress and grasp the ideas: weak entity, relationship, isa, and attributes. After that,
I learned how to change ER diagram into relational schemas, and understand the uses for each diagram. We also learned functional dependency and normal forms
to prevent any anomalies in the data. Lastly, we learned how to construct database with SQL command and find the information we wanted. As you might've known
I am studing biology in college (along with com sci) and I can see myself using SQL to enter data from the experiment into the database for better analysis
and comparison. In addition, I may use it one day if I every become an entrepeneur, managing stock.
